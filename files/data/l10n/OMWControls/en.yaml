MovementSettings: "Movement"

alwaysRun: "Always run"
alwaysRunDescription: |
    If this setting is true, the character is running by default, otherwise the character is walking by default.
    The shift key will temporarily invert this setting, and the caps lock key will invert this setting while it's "locked".

toggleSneak: "Toggle sneak"
toggleSneakDescription: |
    This setting causes the behavior of the sneak key (bound to Ctrl by default)
    to toggle sneaking on and off rather than requiring the key to be held down while sneaking.
    Players that spend significant time sneaking may find the character easier to control with this option enabled.
